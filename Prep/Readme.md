Exploring spatial analysis options using Python scripts in Prep.  

Each of the scripts here relies on a different geocoding service.  

The sample data that I used to test the geocoding in Prep is included as an Excel file.  This is just some random data from the internet...source is listed on the 'source' tab in the Excel file.

These all worked as of 7/23/19 in Tableau Prep Version 2019.3.1 using TabPy.
